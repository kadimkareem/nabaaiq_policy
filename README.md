Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Nabaa IQ app (referred to as “Application”) for mobile devices, created by Kadhum Kareem (referred to as “Service Provider”) as a free service. The Application is provided “AS IS” and is intended solely for its stated functionality.

Information Collection and Use

The Application does not collect any personal data from users. No data such as IP addresses, location, or device details are gathered while you use the Application.

The only permission required by the Application is access to your device’s camera, which is used exclusively for the app’s intended functionality (e.g., capturing photos or videos within the app). The Application does not store, share, or transmit any data captured by the camera.

Third-Party Access

The Application does not transmit any data to third-party services, and no external parties have access to the camera data used by the Application.

Please note that the Application may utilize third-party services such as Google Play Services for app distribution, and these services have their own privacy policies. You can review their privacy policy at:

	•	Google Play Services

Children

The Application is not directed towards children under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since no data is collected by the Application, there is no risk of such data being shared. However, if you believe a child has used the app and shared personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

Security

The Service Provider prioritizes the privacy and security of users. Since the Application does not collect or transmit any data, there are no concerns about unauthorized data access or breaches. The camera permission is solely used for the Application’s purpose.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page, and you are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the Application after any changes will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to follow and be bound by the updated Privacy Policy.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-10-19.

Your Consent

By using the Application, you consent to the use of camera permissions as outlined in this Privacy Policy. No personal data is collected, stored, or processed.

Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the Service Provider via email at kadhum.alrubaye@outlook.com.

This version reflects that the app only uses the camera permission and does not collect any user data.
